        <h1>Knowledge check</h1>
        <h2> learning html </h2>
        <p>thing to remember about html etc or what i know so far?command tag/anything will se</p>
        <!-- answering some odin project question,so you  create paragraph in HTML by using the <p> tag don't forget to close it with </p>,you create a heading with the <h1> there are up to 7 i.e h2 h3 h3 etc the difference between that is that H1 is bigger than h2 and it get smaller the further we go h3>h4>h5 etc
            we use the <strong></strong> to make text bold,<b></b> can also be used but from what i learn it's only visual and better avoid it
        -->
        <h4>what element should you use to make text italicized to add emphasis to it?</h4>
        <p>we should use <!-- <em> like this --> <em>this thing,some other things are hidden</em></p>
        <h4>what relationship does an element have with any nested elements withing it?</h4>
        <p>the relationship is that it is its parent?it contains it,it's easier to read and looks cleaner,a parent can have many children and they can have their own or sibling,we use indentation to keep it clear/clean and easy to read,a title could be a parent using H1 tag and the content would be a nested P tag that talk about whatever H1 was about  </p>
        <h4>what relationship do two elements have if they are at the same lvl of nesting?</h4>
        <p>they are sibling and we use the same lvl of indentation to keep it clear and readable</p>
        <h4>How do you create HTML comments</h4>
        <p>by using <!-- this --> or  ctrl / in vscode which is easier <!--btw i'm writing just so i get used to typing and avoid typos,also i just noticed that H5 is way too small i'll try h4 --> </p>
